            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

They went to the Bishops Pallace, wherein lay severall Armes, and some moneyes of the Countryes: which place Capt. <hi>Bee,</hi> a wollen Draper of that City with 30 men had taken possession of and defended for 3 houres, untill the Cavaliers had fired one part of the house. In which Capt. <hi>Bee</hi> resolved, and so told them he would be consumed, unlesse he might surrender upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propounded by him,) amongst which the protection of his person and estate) the which they agreed too; no sooner was the Pallace deliverd but all conditions broke, the Capt. seized and carryed away prisoner, untill released in the field at the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fight. All his wares and goods put in Carts, with which and the Armes and mony found in the Pallace, together with the plunder, and persons of other honest men of the Towne, they marched on Saturday night to <hi>Gainsborough</hi> 12 miles off.</p>
            <p>This Alarum coming that Friday night to <hi>Belvoyer</hi> Castle to Col. <hi>Rossiter</hi> (who was there upon some occasions of the Country) he forthwith gave the Alarum to <hi>Northampton, Leicester, Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Derby,</hi> and <hi>Rutland,</hi> and desired them to spare what horse they could, to joyne with a Troop of horse lately raised by him, by authority of Parliament for the security of that county; and he would therewith endevour to drive the enemy out of the Countrey againe. The which forces being conjoyned on Sabbath Evening, to the number of 550. (all of them newly raised men) and then understanding by a Letter, received from Sir <hi>Henry Cholmely,</hi> that 600 <hi>Yorkeshire</hi> horse with some Dragoones were on the Northside <hi>Trent</hi> about <hi>Gainsborrow,</hi> who would interrupt their retreating over <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Pomfret</hi> againe, or fight with them if they came over; Col. <hi>Rossiter</hi> marched on Munday morning towards <hi>Gainsborow:</hi> In the midway thither, there met and
<pb facs="tcp:116946:3"/>joyned with him, a Troop of horse from <hi>Lyn,</hi> which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall had put under the command of Capt. <hi>Taylor,</hi> who together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed that night in and about <hi>Waddington</hi> fields 3 miles South of <hi>Lincolne.</hi> On Tuesday morning by three a Clock, they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through <hi>Lincolne</hi> towards <hi>Gainsborow,</hi> and understanding by a <hi>Lincolne</hi> man (who had been taken away prisoner by the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, and had escaped them that night,) that the enemy were all drawn off from <hi>Gainsborow,</hi> at 10. of the clock on Munday Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and were marched towards <hi>Newark;</hi> Col. <hi>Rossiter</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with pursued 18 miles that night, refreshed his horse 4 or 5 hours in the night in a meadow, a mile from <hi>Newark,</hi> where he received intelligence, that the enemy quartered about <hi>Bingham</hi> 6 miles before him; to this place came in to <hi>Rossiters</hi> further assistance about 150 horse, the one halfe from <hi>Derby</hi> and <hi>Rutland,</hi> the other halfe were Gentlemen and Freeholders of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and <hi>Leicester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> who voluntarily would adventure their lives for their Countryes freedome. On Wednesday morning <hi>Rossiter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out a forlorne-hope 150 of the ablest horse, under the command of Capt. <hi>Champion</hi> of <hi>Nottingham-shire,</hi> to pursue at a fast Rate, and so by falling on the enemies Reere, to enforce them to a stand or halt, till he with the body of horse could come up to them: They after 7 miles advance over tooke the Reere of them, whom skirmishing with, made their body of horse and foot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 7 or 800 at least, to draw up in a large Beane field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Willoughby</hi> 7 miles from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> of which <hi>Rossiter</hi> being informed from the commander of the forlorn, by march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a full Trot (having no Dragoones or foot with him) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a short time brought his horse into the field, himselfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the right wing wherein he resolved to charge, But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that the enemies strength were placed in their body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a party of foot, winged with horse, and those horse flanked with Musketeers, and that with them the men of best quallity (as appeared by their outward Garbes) seemed to be mounted; he resolved to Charge the Battaile, assigning his right wing, to be commanded by Col. <hi>White,</hi> and the left wing by Col, <hi>Hacker,</hi> placing 2 reserves of horse in the Reere, being suddaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:116946:3"/>thus ordered, the enemies word (<hi>Jesus</hi>) and <hi>Rossiters</hi> (<hi>Faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>) he advanced to the charge, who was received with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. The bodies and reserves through eagernesse close in together; whereby the encounter proved very sharpe, both sides falling presently to Swords point, and so continued in close fight neither party giving ground for some space, till by the fircenesse of each party both were put into disorder, being so intermixt, doing execution each on other, the dispute continued a while doubtfull, at last it pleased God to give a full and absolute victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Rossiters</hi> forces, as may appeare by the quallity and number of prisoners taken; all their Colours, Armes, and Carriages. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200. that were best horsed (whereof divers Papists) got off in small parties, severall of them wounded, but at least one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them, were that night and next morning taken in their flight by <hi>Leicester, Belvoier, Burly,</hi> and other honest Country-men, amongst whom was Sir <hi>Philip Mounkton</hi> their Generall disarmed and brought into <hi>Nottingham</hi> by Mr. <hi>Boyer,</hi> a high Constable of that County, who deservedly now weares his Sword.</p>
            <p>In the first charge Col. <hi>Rossiter</hi> lost his head-peece, received a shot through the right thigh, and some other painfull wounds with a Musket Bullet, notwithstanding which he kept the field fighting till he saw the battaile wholly wonne, not discovering his wounding to any person, for feare it might prove a discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the Souldiers: after which being ready to fall through losse of blood, he rode to <hi>Nottingham</hi> where he lyeth Capable of recovery, through the blessing of God upon the meanes used for that end.</p>
            <p>In this service, Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> (commander of the <hi>Leicester</hi> horse) who is wounded, and Col. <hi>White</hi> (commander of the <hi>Nottingham</hi> horse, having onely his horse cut) merrited much honour for their expressed valour. And no lesse is deserved by all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Officers and Souldiers, who being all newly raised men, and mounted upon new bought horses (saving Capt. <hi>Taylors</hi> Troope, and 40 of <hi>Belvoier</hi> horse commanded by Lievt. <hi>Deane,</hi> who likewise is slightly wounded,) yet not one of them, nor the country-men, who were strangers to such hard service, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb facs="tcp:116946:4"/>to turne his backe, during the whole brunt. And as it is confessed by the prisoners taken, That the advantage they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended they had against <hi>Rossiters</hi> men by reason of their new listing, gave them as great encouragement to encounter them (had they been double their number) as confidence to have beaten and ruined them; so the victory is solely to be ascribed to the power and goodnesse of God; who therein hath fulfilled in part, that which is foretold by the Prophet, concerning the great things which his people shall performe in the distruction of his and their enemies. <hi>That the feeble shall be come as</hi> David, <hi>and the stronge shall become as an Angel of God in Heroick Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not above 30 of <hi>Rossiters</hi> men slaine upon the place, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to his own Troop being the highest Officer, at whose fall his colours were lost and for a while in the enemies hands, untill Cornet <hi>Ridgeley,</hi> a reformade in the same Troop recovered them; Captain <hi>Greenwood,</hi> who commanded <hi>Derby</hi> Troop dangerously wounded, and so are many other common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>About an houre after the fight, there came in two gallant Troopes of horse from <hi>Northampton,</hi> who had been in sooner but the crosse marching of the enemy, impeaded their finding us sooner, who presently advanced in pursuit of them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Cholmely</hi> also with 600 <hi>Yorke-shire</hi> horse, came then up to us over <hi>Nottingham</hi> Bridge, by whose lying on the North side <hi>Trent,</hi> and preventing the enemies Retreat that way, was this oportunity gained of fighting them; those <hi>Yorke-shire</hi> horse the next day advanced to assist other <hi>Yorke-shire</hi> forces already there, to block up <hi>Pomfret</hi>

            <p>By severall Letters taken in their Generall Officers Pockets, it appears that men of high and low degree in severall Countyes, (before unsuspected.) are deeply engaged in the promoting and contributing toward a generall rising in many parts, some of the Prisoners affirme, That their Army resolved to have march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Southward through <hi>Leicester-shire</hi> and <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> in whose march they doubted not but to have encreased to many thousands, and to have j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
